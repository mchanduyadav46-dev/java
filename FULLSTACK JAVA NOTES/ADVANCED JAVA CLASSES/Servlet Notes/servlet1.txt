Web Application 
===============
A web application is a software application that runs in a web server.

Web applications are interactive, data-driven software accessible via a web browser via HTTP protocol.

In general,  A web application is collection of web resource programs having the capability to generate web pages.

We have two types of web pages.

1) Static web page / Passive web page 
-------------------------------------
A web page with fixed content is called static web page.
ex:
	Home Page 
	AboutUs Page 
	ContactUs page 
	Facebook Login page 
	and etc.

2) Dynamic web page / Active web page 
-------------------------------------
A web page with dynamic content is called dynamic web page.
ex:
	live cricket score page 
	stock market share value page 
	news page 
	and etc.

We have two types of web resource programs.

1) Static Web Resource program 
------------------------------
A web resource program which is used to develop static web pages is called static web resource program.
ex:
	HTML program 
	CSS program 
	JavaScript program 
	Bootstrap program 
	AngularJS program 
	and etc.

2) Dynamic Web Resource program 
-------------------------------
A web resource program which is used to develop dynamic web pages is called dynamic web resource program.
ex:
	Servlet program 
	JSP program 
	and etc.

Based on the position and execution these web resource programs are categoried into two types.

1) Client Side Web Resource program
----------------------------------- 
A web resource program which executes at client side (browser window) is called client side web resource program.
ex:
	HTML program 
	CSS program 
	JavaScript program 
	Bootstrap program 
	and etc.

All static web resource programs are called client side web resource programs.


2) Server Side Web Resource program 
-----------------------------------
A Web resource program which executes at server side is called server side web resource program.
ex:
	Servlet program. 
	JSP program.

All dynamic web resource programs are called server side web resource programs.




Web Application and Web Resource program Execution 
===================================================
Java application executes manually.

Web application and Web resource program execute at the time when they have requested.

Diagram: servlet1.1

With respect to the diagram:
----------------------------

1) Enduser gives the request to web resource program.

2) Web server traps that request and passes that request to approriate web resource prog.

3) Web resource program executes the logic to process the request.

4) Web resource program communicates with database software if neccessary.

5) Web resource program gives the result to web server.

6) Web server sends the output to browser window as dynamic response.


Note:
-----
The process of keeping an application in a server is called deployment and reverse is called undeployment.



Web Server 
==========
A web server is a combination of hardware and software that stores, processes, delivers web content such as web pages, images, audio, video and etc over internet.

A web server is a piece of software which is used to automate whole process of web application and web resource program execution. 

ex:
	Tomcat, Resin and etc.


Responsibilities of web server 
-------------------------------
1) It takes contineous requests from client.

2) It passes each request to appropriate web resource program.

3) It provides environment to deploy and undeploy the web applications.

4) It adds middleware services only to deployed web applications.

5) It allows to execute client side web resource programs at browser window.

6) It gathers the result from web resource program and sends to browser window 
   as dynamic response.

7) It is used to automate whole process of web application and web resource program
   execution.

Note:
-----
	To execute java program we required JRE/JVM.
	To execute servlet program we required servlet container.
	To execute JSP program we required JSP container.

Web Container 
=============
A web container is a software application or a program which is used to manage whole life cycle of web resource program i.e from birth to death.

Servlet container manages whole life cycle of servlet program.

JSP container manages whole life cycle of jsp program.

Some part of industry considers servlet container and JSP container are web containers.

Every web server is designed to support servlet container and JSP container. So we don't need to arrange it seperately.

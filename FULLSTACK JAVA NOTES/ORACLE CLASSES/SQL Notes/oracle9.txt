DCL commands 
============

Schema 
------
	Schame is a memory location which is used to run SQL commands.

Privileges
----------
	Permissions given to a user is called privileges.
	We have two types of privileges.
	1) System privilege  : Permissions given by DBA to user.
	2) Object privilege  : Permissions given by one user to another user.


grant command 
-------------
It is used to grant the permissions to the user.

syntax:
------
	grant <privilege1>,<privilege2> to <user_name>;


revoke command
---------------
It is used to revoke the permissions from the user.

syntax:
-------
	revoke <privilege1>,<privilege2> from <user_name>;

DBA> create user anusha identified by anusha;
DBA> create user kumar identified by kumar;

anusha> conn anusha/anusha  -- logon denied

kumar> conn kumar/kumar  -- logon denied 

DBA> grant connect,resource to anusha,kumar;

anusha> conn anusha/anusha
  
kumar> conn kumar/kumar  


kumar> 
create table employee(eid number(3),ename varchar2(10),esal number(10));
insert into employee values(501,'Lara',25000);
insert into employee values(502,'Nelson',38000);
insert into employee values(503,'Jessica',45000);
commit;

anusha> select * from employee;  -- table or view does not exist

kumar> grant select on employee to anusha;

anusha> select * from  kumar.employee;

anusha> delete from kumar.employee;  -- insufficient privileges

kumar> grant update,delete on employee to anusha;

anusha> delete from kumar.employee;

Synonyms 
========
Alter name given to a table is called synonym.

We can use synonym name instead of table name for all commands.

Using synonyms length of a table will reduce.

syntax:
------
	create synonym <synonym_name> for <object_name>;

ex:
	create synonym sy1 for student;

	select * from sy1;

	delete from sy1 where sno=104;

	select * from sy1;
	select * from student;

DDL commands
============
We have five commands in DDL.

1) create (tables)

2) alter (columns)

3) drop (tables)

4) truncate (Records/Rows)

5) rename (tables)

alter command
=============
Using alter command we can perform following activities very easily.

1) Adding new columns 

2) Modifying existing columns 

3) Dropping columns

4) Renaming columns 

1) Adding new columns 
----------------------
Using alter command we can add new columns.

syntax:
------
	alter table <table_name> ADD (col1 datatype(size),......,colN datatype(size));
ex:
	alter table student ADD (pincode number(8));
	alter table student ADD (state varchar2(10));
	alter table student ADD (pincode number(8),state varchar2(10));

	update student set pincode=500036 where sno=101;


2) Modifying existing columns 
-----------------------------
Using alter command we can modify existing columns.

We can change size of a column only when existing values are fit into new size.

syntax:
------
	alter table <table_name> MODIFY (col datatype(size));

ex:
	desc student;

	alter table student MODIFY (pincode number(10));

	desc student;

We can change the datatype of a column only when that column is empty.

ex:
	alter table student MODIFY (state number(10));	
		
	desc student;

3) Dropping columns
-------------------
Using alter command we can drop the columns from existing table.

syntax:
-------
	alter table <table_name> DROP (col1,col2,....,colN);
ex:
	alter table student DROP(pincode,state);

4) Renaming columns 
----------------------
Using alter command we can rename the column name.

syntax:
------
	alter table <table_name> RENAME column <old_name> to <new_name>;
ex:
	alter table student rename column sadd to city;
	
	alter table emp rename column esal to dailywages;

	alter table emp rename column job to designation;
	
Drop command 
===========
A drop command is used to drop the table from database.

syntax:
-------
	drop table student;
	drop table emp;
	drop table dept; 


truncate command
=================
A truncate command is used to delete the rows permanently from database.

syntax:
------
	truncate table <table_name>;
ex:
	truncate table student;
	truncate table dept;
	truncate table emp;

Q) What is the difference between delete and truncate command?

delete 					truncate 
-------------				---------
It is a DML command.			It is a DDL command.

Records are deleted temperory.		Records are deleted permanently.

We can rollback the data.		We can't rollback the data.

Where clause can be used.		Where clause can't be used.




rename command
================
A rename command is used to rename the table name.

syntax:
------
	rename <old_name> to <new_name>;
ex:
	rename student to students;
	rename emp to employees;
	rename dept to deparments;

Functions 
==========
Functions are used to manipulate the data items and give result.

We have two types of functions.

1) Group Functions / Multiple Rows Functions 

2) Scalar Functions / Single Row Functions 


1) Group Functions
-------------------
Group functions are applicable for multiple rows.

We have following list of group functions.
ex:
	sum(), avg(), min(), max(), count(*) and count(expression).


Q) Write a query to display sum of salary of each employee?

	select sum(esal) from emp;


Q) Write a query to display average salary of each employee?

	select avg(esal) from emp;


Q) Write a query to display highest salary from emp table?

	select max(esal) from emp;

Q) Write a query to display lowest salary from emp table?
	
	select min(esal) from emp;

Q) What is difference between count(*) and count(expression) ? 

count(*)
---------
	It returns number of records present in database table.
	It includes null records.
	ex:
		select count(*) from emp; // 6
		select count(*) from dept; // 4 
		select count(*) from student; // 5 

count(expression)
----------------
	It returns number values present in a column.
	It does not include null values.
	ex:
		select count(eid) from emp;
		select count(comm) from emp;

userlist table 
--------------
drop table userlist;
create table userlist(uname varchar2(10),pwd varchar2(10));
insert into userlist values('raja','rani');
insert into userlist values('king','kingdom');
commit;


Q) Write a query to check given username and password valid or not?

	select count(*) from userlist where uname='raja' and pwd='rani';


Dual table 
===========
Dual table is a dummy table which is used to perform arithmetic operations and to see the current system date.

It contains one row and one column.

ex:
	select 10+20 from dual; // 30
	select 10*4 from dual; // 40
	select 10-5 from dual; // 5 

	select sysdate from dual;
	select current_date from dual;

2) Scalar Functions
--------------------
Scalar functions are categories into four types.

i) Character Functions 

ii) Number Functions 

iii) Date Functions 

iv) Conversion Functions

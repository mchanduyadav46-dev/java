delete command 
===============
A delete command is used to delete the rows from database table.

syntax:
-------
	delete from <table_name> where condition;

ex:
	delete from student where sno=104;
	delete from student where sname='ramulu';
	delete from student where sadd='vizag';

Note:
------
	If we won't use where clause then all rows will be deleted.
	ex:
		delete from student;
		delete from dept;
		delete from emp;


Interview questions 
===================
Q) Write a query to display employees information whose salary is greater then 25000?

	select * from emp where esal>25000;

Q) Write a query to promote employee from clerk to salesman whose employee id is 202?

	update emp set job='Salesman' where eid=202;

Q) Write a query to terminate all employees whose salary is greater then 35000?

	delete from emp where esal>35000;	


Logical operators 
=================
Logical operators are used to declare multiple conditions in where clause.

We have three logical operators.

1) AND 

2) OR 

3) NOT 

1) AND
-------
	It returns the records if all conditions are true.
	Here all conditions must be from same row. 
	ex:
		select * from emp where eid=201 AND ename='Alan';

		select * from emp where eid=201 AND ename='Jose'; // no rows selected 

		select * from emp where eid=201 AND ename='Lisa'; // no rows selected 

2) OR 
------
	It returns the records if any condition is true.
	Here conditions can be from any row.
	ex:
		select * from emp where eid=201 OR ename='Alan'; // 1 record 

		select * from emp where eid=201 OR ename='Jose'; // 2 records 

		select * from emp where eid=201 OR ename='Lisa'; // 1 record 

3) NOT 
-------
	It returns the records except the condition.
	Here <> denoted as NOT operator.
	ex:
		select * from emp where NOT eid=201;
		select * from emp where eid<>201;	

		select * from emp where NOT ename='Alan';
		select * from emp where  ename<>'Alan';

Between Operator 
===============
Between operator return the records those who are in the range of values.

In between operator  first we need to lower limit then higher limit.

ex:
	select * from student where sno between 101 and 105;

	select * from emp where eid between 201 and 204;


IN Operator 
============
IN operator  is a replacement of OR operator.
IN operator returns the records those who are matching in the list.
ex:
	select * from emp where eid IN (201,202,203);
	select * from emp where ename IN ('Alan','Jose','Lisa');

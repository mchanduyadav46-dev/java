Sequences
=========
Sequence is an object which is used to generate the numbers.

syntax:
-------
	create sequence <sequence_name> start with <value> increment by <value>;

ex:
	create sequence sq1 start with 1 increment by 1;
	create sequence sq2 start with 101 increment by 1;
	create sequence sq3 start with 10 increment by 10;

We have two pseudo's in a sequence.

1) NEXTVAL 
----------
	It is used to generate next number in a sequence.

2) CURRVAL 
-----------
	It returns last number generated by the sequence.

student table 
-------------
drop table student;

create table student(sno number(3),sname varchar2(10),sadd varchar2(12));

create sequence sq1 start with 101 increment by 1;

insert into student values(sq1.NEXTVAL,'raja','hyd');
insert into student values(sq1.NEXTVAL,'ravi','delhi');
insert into student values(sq1.NEXTVAL,'ramana','vizag');
commit;

select * from student;


To see the last number generated by the sequence we need to use below query.
ex:
	select sq1.CURRVAL from dual;


Q) Write a query to see the list of sequences present in a database?

	select sequence_name from user_sequences;


Q) Write a query to drop the sequence?

	drop sequence sq1;



Indexes 
=======
Index is used to improve the performance of select statement.

Index is a database is similar to index in a book.

Index we can create only to those columns which are widely used in where clause.

Whenever we create index, two columns will be created one is ROWID and another is indexed column and all the records stored in ascending order of indexed column.

ex:
			INDEX Table 
		--------------------------------------
		ROWID		|	INDEXED COLUMN
		--------------------------------------
				|	9000
				|	16000
				|	27000	
				|	29000	
				|	32000	
				|	41000
		--------------------------------------	

We have two types of indexes.

1) Simple index 

2) Complex index 


1) Simple index
-----------------
If index is created only for one column is called simple index.
ex:
	create index idx1 ON emp(esal);

Here index is used when we use esal in where clause.

ex:
	select * from emp where esal=27000;


2) Complex index 
----------------
If index is created for multiple columns is complex index.
ex:
	create index idx2 on emp(eid,deptno);

Here index is used when we are using eid and deptno in where clause.
ex:
	select * from emp where eid=201 and deptno=10;


Q) Write a query to see the list of indexes present in database?

	select index_name from user_indexes;


Q) Write a query to drop the index?

	drop index idx1;
	drop index idx2;

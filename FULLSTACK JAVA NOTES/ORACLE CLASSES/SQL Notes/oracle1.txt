Types of data 
=============
We have two types of data.

1) Unstructured data 
--------------------
Data which is not in readable format is called unstructured data.

Meaningless data is called unstructured.

ex:
	201	  Lakemba	SYD	NSW	 AUS 


2) Structured data 
------------------
Data which is in readable format is called structured data.

Meaning full data is called structured data.

ex:
	Unit	  Locality      City    State	 Country 
	----	  -------	----	-----	 --------
	201	  Lakemba	SYD	NSW	 AUS

Oracle 
=======
It is one of the database which is used to store structured data.

It is also consider as relational database.

It is a product of Oracle Corporation.

It is classified into two types.

1) SQL  (Structured Query Language)

2) PL/SQL (Procedural Language Extensions to Structured Query Lang)

Q) What is the difference between DBMS and RDBMS?

Client/Server Architecture 
==========================
In this architecture we will see how our data will store from frontend to backend.

Diagram: oracle1.1


Frontend
--------
The one which is visible to the end user to perform some operations is called frontend.
ex:
	C++, Java, Python, .Net, Perl, Scala and etc.

Communication Channel 
----------------------
It acts like a bridge between frontend and backend.
ex:
	JDBC - Java Database Connectivity 
	ODBC - Open Database Connectivity 
	PDBC - Python Database Connectivity 

Backend 
-------
The one which is not visible to the end user but it performs some operations based on the instructions given by frontend is called backend.

ex:
	Oracle, MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Sybase and etc. 


Management System 
=================
Management system is a software which is used to manage the data.

Using management system we can perform following activities very easily.

1) Adding new data 

2) Modifying existing data 

3) Deleting unnecessary data 

4) Selecting Required data 


RDBMS 
=====
RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System.

If a database is created based on relational theories to manage the database is called relational database management system.

We have following list of relational databases.
ex:
	Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Teradata and etc.


SQL
=====
SQL stands for Structured Query Language which is pronounce as SEQUEL.

It is used to communicate with oracle database.

It is a case insensitive language.

It is a command based language.

Every command must starts with verb and ends with semicolon.

It is developed by Mr. Codd in 1972 (By IBM).

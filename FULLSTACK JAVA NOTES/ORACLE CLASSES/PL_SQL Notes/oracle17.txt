Q) Write a PL/SQL program to perform square of a given number?

	create or replace procedure ret_square(A IN OUT number)
	is
	begin 
	A:= A * A;
	END;
	/

Steps to invoke a procedure having IN OUT parameter
---------------------------------------------------
step1:
------
	Declare a bind variable.
	ex:
		variable N number;

step2:
------
	Initialize the bind variable.
	ex:
		BEGIN 
		:N := 5;
		END;
		/

step3:
-----
	Execute the procedure.
	ex:
		exec  ret_square(:N);

step4:
-----
	Print the bind variable.
	ex:
		print N;

Procedures allow DML operations.


Q)  Write a procedure to insert a record into student table?

	create or replace procedure insert_record(L_sno IN student.sno%TYPE,
						   L_sname IN student.sname%TYPE,
						    L_sadd IN student.sadd%TYPE)
	is
	begin 
	insert into student values(L_sno,L_sname,L_sadd);
	DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Record Inserted');

	/ 

We can invoke above procedure as follow.
ex:
	exec   update_record(101);


Q) Write a procedure to delete the student record based on student number?

	create or replace procedure delete_record(L_sno IN student.sno%TYPE)
	is
	begin 
	delete from student where sno=L_sno;
	DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Record Deleted');
	END;
	/

We can invoke above procedure as follow.

Q) Write a query to drop the procedure from database?

	drop procedure p1;
	drop procedure sum;
	drop procedure ret_sum;

Functions 
===========
It is a named PL/SQL block which must and should returns a value.

syntax:
------
	create or replace function function_name 
	return datatype 
	is
	begin 
	-
	-
	-	
	end;
	/

Q) Write a PL/SQL function to accept two numbers and return it sum?

	create or replace function f1(A number, B number)
	return number
	is
	C number;	
	begin 
	C:=A+B;
	return C;
	END;
	/
	
We can invoke above function as follow.
ex:
	select f1(10,20) from dual;



Q) Write a PL/SQL function to accept one salary and find out 10% of Tax?

	create or replace function ret_tax(L_esal emp.esal%TYPE)
	return number
	is
	TAX number;
	begin 
	TAX := L_esal*10/100;
	return TAX;
	END;
	/

We can invoke above function as follow.
ex:
	select ret_tax(10000) from dual;
	select eid,ename,esal,ret_tax(esal) from emp;
	select eid,ename,esal,ret_tax(esal) as TAX from emp;


Q) What is the difference between procedures and functions?

procedures					functions
----------					----------

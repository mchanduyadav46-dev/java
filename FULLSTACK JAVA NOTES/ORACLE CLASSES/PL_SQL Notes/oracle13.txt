Q) Write a query to display employees information whose salary is greater then Jessica salary?

	select * from emp where esal > 
				(select esal from emp where ename='Jessica');


Q) Write a query to display second highest salary from emp table?

	select max(esal) from emp where esal<(select max(esal) from emp);



2) Multiple Row Sub query 
--------------------------
If a sub query returns more then one row is called multiple row sub query.

In multiple row sub query we need to use multiple row operators.

We have three multiple row operators.

i) ALL 
-------
	select * from emp where esal > ALL (select esal from emp where deptno=10);

ii) ANY 
--------
	select * from emp where esal > ANY (select esal from emp where deptno=10);
	select * from emp where esal < ANY (select esal from emp where deptno=10);

iii) IN 
-------
	select * from emp where esal IN (select esal from emp where deptno=10);

3) Multiple Column Sub Query 
---------------------------
If a sub query returns more then one column is called multiple column sub query.

In multiple column sub query we will use IN operator.

ex:
---
	select * from emp where(eid,ename,esal) IN (select eid,ename,esal from emp);
	select eid,ename,esal from emp where(eid,ename,esal) IN 
			(select eid,ename,esal from emp);


interview question 
-------------------
Q) Write a query to display last three records from emp table?

	SQL
	----
	select * from emp order by eid desc where rownum IN (1,2,3);

	SUBQUERY 
	--------
	select * from (select * from emp order by eid desc) where rownum<=3;

Q) What is the difference between RDBMS and MongoDB ?

RDBMS 						MongoDB 
---------					---------
It is a relational database.			It is a non-relational database.
						(It is a document based database)

It does not store the data in key and 		It stores the data in key and value 
value pair.					pair.

It is not designed for heirarchical data.	It is designed for hierachical data.

It supports structured query language.		It supports JSON query language.

It contains tables.				It contains collections.

It is row based.				It is document based.

It is column based.				It is field based.

It is slower.					It is faster.

PL/SQL 
=======
PL/SQL stands for Procedural Language extensions to Structure Query Language.

Using PL/SQL we can achieve following features.

1) We can achieve programming features like control statements, loops and etc.

2) It reduces network traffic.

3) We can display custom messages by using concept of exception handling.

4) We can perform related operations by using the concept of triggers.

5) We can store the PL/SQL program permanently to database for repeated execution.


PL/SQL BLOCK 
=============
A PL/SQL program is also known as PL/SQL block.

syntax:
------
	DECLARE 
	-
	-  -- Declaration Section 
	-
	BEGIN
	-
	-  -- Executable Section 
	-
	EXCEPTION 
	-
	-  -- Exception Section 
	-
	END;
	/

Declaration Section 
--------------------
It is used to declare variables, exceptions, cursors and etc.
It is optional section.

Executable Section 
-------------------
It contains actual code of a PL/SQL program.
It is mandatory section.

Exception Section
-------------------
It contains lines of code which is executed when exception is raised.
It is optional section.


To see the output in PL/SQL we need to execute below command.
ex:
	SQL> set   serveroutput  on 


Q) Write a PL/SQL program to print Hello World?

	BEGIN 
	DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Hello World');
	END;
	/

	Here '/' is used to submit the PL/SQL program into database.


Q) Write a PL/SQL program to perform sum of two numbers?

	DECLARE 
	A number;
	B number;
	C number;
	BEGIN
	A:=10;
	B:=20;
	C:=A+B;
	DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(C);
	END;
	/

Declaration and intialization using single line
----------------------------------------------
	DECLARE 
	A number:=10;
	B number:=20;
	C number:=A+B;
	BEGIN
	DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('sum of two numbers is ='||C);
	END;
	/

Using '&' symbol we can read dynamic inputs.

ex:
---
	DECLARE 
	A number(3);
	B number(3);
	C number(6);
	BEGIN
	A:=&a;
	B:=&b;
	C:=A+B;
	DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('sum of two numbers is ='||C);
	END;
	/
